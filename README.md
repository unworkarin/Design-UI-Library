# Design / UI Library

A small, framework-agnostic **Design / UI Library** built with vanilla Web Components (Custom Elements) and CSS variables for theming.
Designed to be Sponsor-friendly: compact, documented, and easy to fork — perfect for GitHub Sponsors.

## Highlights

- Lightweight Web Components: `<ui-button>`, `<ui-card>`, and theme utilities.
- CSS variables for theming and easy customization.
- Example demo page to try components locally (no build step required).
- FUNDING.yml and Sponsor guidance included.

## Quickstart

1. Open `examples/index.html` in a browser (no server required) to see the demo.
2. Or serve the folder with a static server (e.g. `python -m http.server`) and open `http://localhost:8000/examples/index.html`.
3. Use the components by importing the JS module in your project (see `examples/index.html`).

## Sponsorship

If this UI library saves you time, please consider sponsoring development to fund:
- More components (modals, dropdowns, inputs, data table)
- Accessibility (a11y) and design tokens work
- React/Vue wrappers and Storybook gallery

Add a Sponsor button and `FUNDING.yml` to your GitHub repo to collect support.

## Structure

- `src/ui_lib` — web components and styles
- `examples` — demo HTML
- `docs` — usage notes and design tokens
- `.github` — CI and templates
